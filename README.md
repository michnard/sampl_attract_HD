# Combining Sampling Methods with Attractor Dynamics in Spiking Models of Head-Direction Systems
Code supporting paper "Combining Sampling Methods with Attractor Dynamics in Spiking Models of Head-Direction Systems" by Vojko Pjanovic, Jacob Zavatone-Veth, Paul Masset, Sander Keemink & Michele Nardin.
Code written by Vojko Pjanovic and Michele Nardin.

The notebooks include the code for: 
- "Figure1.ipynb", panels B and C, to plot the posterior over Poisson spikes and sampling-based moment estimation.
- "Figure2.ipynb", panels A and D, to implement sampling from a bimodal distribution and compute subthreshold correlations.
- "Figure3.ipynb", panel B, to implement sampling based inference, and also the code for Supp. Fig. 3 to compute statistics on the posterior.
- "Figure4.ipynb", panel C, sampling-based spiking HD network.
- "Figure5.ipynb", panels A,B,C,D,E,F, to compute all the predictions discussed in the text.
