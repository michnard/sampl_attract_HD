# Combining Sampling Methods with Attractor Dynamics in Spiking Models of Head-Direction Systems
Code supporting paper "Combining Sampling Methods with Attractor Dynamics in Spiking Models of Head-Direction Systems" by Vojko Pjanovic, Jacob Zavatone-Veth, Paul Masset, Sander Keemink & Michele Nardin.
Code written by Vojko Pjanovic and Michele Nardin.

The notebooks include the code for: 
- "Figure1.ipynb", panels B and C, to plot the posterior over Poisson spikes and sampling-based moment estimation.
- "Figure2.ipynb", panels B, C, and D, to plot the attractor manifold, the model components overview, and the effect of high vs. low input noise.
- "Figure3.ipynb", panel B and C, to plot the effect of a resetting visual anchor.
- "Figure4.ipynb", panel A, B, C, and D, to plot the subthreshold voltage correlations, comparing fast and slow correlations with the fast and slow connectivity, effects of low vs high input noise, and the skewness of the posterior.
